- 👋🏻 Hi, I'm Domenico, a 28 year old Italian boy, happily married.
Italian but with his head and body always outside Italy.
If I had to describe myself in a few lines, I would write this:
I spent a beautiful childhood in the company of my best friends: ⚽️ a ball, 💻 and a computer.

- ❌ But then, I got my higher education sector wrong.
- ❌ I lost years working everywhere, but never for what I was most passionate about.
- ♻️ These mistakes led me to the turning point.
- 💙 "If I love my job, it will be like not working at all."
- 💻 So, now I'm studying to become a Full Stack Developer.

- 🎓 Progress on start2impact:
★ HTML and CSS - Completed!
★ JavaScript - in progress ...

- My works are available on my GitHub profile: https://github.com/domenicopasquale
